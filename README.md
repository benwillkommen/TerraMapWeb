# TerrariaPal
TerrariaPal is a modest web app written in python/Flask that can be installed on a Terraria server to allow users to generate maps and download world files without access to the server.

To use it, you must have [TerraMap](https://terramap.codeplex.com/) installed on your server, and the terramapcmd executable on your path.
